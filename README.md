**The source for this game is hideously ugly.** It was developed for the Ludum Dare competition, in which there is a 48 hour time limit, and so many terrible shortcuts were made. I would not recommend looking at the source to anybody.

For details about the game, see the [Ludum Dare submission](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-30/?action=preview&uid=26559).
